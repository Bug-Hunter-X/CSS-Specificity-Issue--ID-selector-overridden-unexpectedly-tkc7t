To resolve this issue, ensure that there are no other styles that have an equivalent or higher specificity to the `#myElement` selector. One way to do this is to inspect your CSS rules and ensure no inheriting styles or selectors override it. You might need to adjust selectors or add more specific selectors to make sure the `#myElement` style always gets applied. For example, if there's a conflicting style coming from a parent, consider making the `#myElement` style more specific or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally not recommended).

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue !important; /* Use !important as a last resort */
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green; 
}
```

**Note:** Using `!important` is generally discouraged as it can make your CSS harder to maintain.  The best solution is to identify and resolve the source of the specificity conflict in your stylesheets.
