This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS specificity bug.  The main issue lies in the unexpected behavior of ID selectors when conflicting with inherited styles or other selectors of equal specificity. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. The problem arises when an ID selector, expected to always have higher precedence, is overshadowed due to the way specificity works in CSS. The solution focuses on addressing specificity conflicts and ensures that the intended style from the ID selector always takes precedence.
